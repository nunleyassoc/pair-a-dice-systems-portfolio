# Enemies

Movement, interaction, and combat-related scripts used by various enemy types
throughout the game.

## Highlights
- Idle movement logic for:
  - Butterflies (airborne wandering)
  - Fish (underwater swimming)
  - Crabs (ground-based navigation)
- Snake attack behavior
- Gull behavior for stealing and carrying objects
- Reusable health bar system shared across enemies

These scripts focus on readable state-based behavior and reusable motion logic.
