# Physics Systems

Shared RigidBody3D scripts that allow for highly customizable objects.

## Highlights
- Unified water physics affecting **all RigidBody3D objects**
  - This includes all Enemies, items, pickups
- Centralized buoyancy and drag logic to avoid per-entity duplication
- Pickup and throw system with multiplayer-safe authority handling
- Deterministic force application for predictable interactions

These systems allow enemies and objects to naturally interact with the environment.
